graphql errors explanation:

"Variable '$uid' of required type 'String!' was not provided.":
    you probably forgot a comma `,` or have comma after last variable
    in query variables list
	
"Cannot return null for non-nullable field Region.uid.":
    schema ObjectType is probably not imported to the schema.py or is not in argument of make_executable_schema()
    OR check the schema for correct type, for example: `regions: Region!` instead of `regions: [Region!]`

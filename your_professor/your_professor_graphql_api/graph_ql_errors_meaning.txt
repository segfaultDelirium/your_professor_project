graphql errors explanation:

"Variable '$uid' of required type 'String!' was not provided.":
    you probably forgot a comma `,` or have comma after last variable
    in query variables list
	
"Cannot return null for non-nullable field Region.uid.":
    schema ObjectType is probably not imported to the schema.py or is not in argument of make_executable_schema()
    OR check the schema for correct type, for example: `regions: Region!` instead of `regions: [Region!]`

if by mistake you put a `required=True` as argument to RelationshipFrom,
    it will throw exception `neomodel.exceptions.NodeClassAlreadyDefined: <exception str() failed>`
    instead use cardinality

"TypeError: 'frozenset' object is not callable"
    reviewed node is probable old and was created before model changed to inherit from ReviewableNode
    the node you want to review must be deleted and created again

"graphql.error.graphql_error.GraphQLError: resolve_connect_review_to_tag() got multiple values for argument 'uid_review'"
    you probably forgot arguments _, info to your resolver function
